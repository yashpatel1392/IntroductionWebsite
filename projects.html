                        <p>This project was to develop a website using Amazon Web Services resources with a team. Our project idea was to create a website which would convert HEIC images, 
                            which is the default format of the images taken from an iPhone, to JPG format. Resources such as AWS Cognito, AWS API Gateway, API Lambda, AWS DynamDB, AWS S3 
                            Bucket, AWS Amplify, and AWS CodeCommit were utilized to design the website. My main responsibility for this project was to design a way to launch all AWS 
                            services which were required with their specific configuration with a minimal effort from the user. I wrote bash scripts and AWS CloudFormation templates which 
                            would deploy all the required services with necessary configuration with also giving an option to kill and delete all the resources when needed to shut down the website.</p>

                    <td>
                        <p>This project was one of the projects for the Computing IV class I took in Spring 2022. The project was to create a program in C++ to simulate the motion of N 
                            celestial bodies using the C++ SFML library and the leapfrog scheme. It involved designing the CelestialBody class for initializing and drawing a single 
                            celestial body and the Universe class which would utilize vectors and smart pointers to hold objects for each planet. The extraction operator was also overloaded 
                            for both the classes to parse the input file with the information such as positions, velocity, and masses of each planet.</p>

                        <p>I was a part of the First Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 5962 for 3 years of my high school where I was part of the software subteam. I led the software subteam 
                        which included about 5-10 members where my main duties were organizing and managing all software related tasks within the team alongside the team mentors. I was 
                        responsible for designing and implementing the autonomous task performed by the robot using motion profiling, PID Control, and various sensors such as ultrasonics 
                        and IMUS.</p>
