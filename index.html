			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am Yash Patel, a student at University of Massachusetts Lowell, with a major in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I have been 
				interested in programming ever since high school when I joined First Robotics and wrote my first program in Java for one of the classes.</p>
			<p>Being part of First Robotics for 3 years of my high school had boosted my interest towards Computer Science. During summer of 2020, I received 
				an opportunity to work as an intern at the Human Robot Interaction Lab at UMass Lowell, where I gained understanding of robotics research.</p>
			<p>I returned back to work as an intern with the UMass Lowell NERVE Center and HRI Lab the following summer and since then I have been working as an Undergraduate 
				Research Assistant where my main duties involve writing software in various languages to perform repetitive tasks with various robots to evaluate 
				their capabilities.</p>
			<p>My academic interests include robotics and learning new programming languages. My hobbies include watching movies and travelling with my friends and family.</p>
